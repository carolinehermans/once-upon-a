Once upon a time there lived a girl called Alice . She went to the museum one day. But, the museum was closed because every day lots of the new guards were missing. Alice was secretly an agent of the famous detective:Mr John Clove. She wanted to find out what was happening every day. She then hid in the museum at night. She saw a jelly monster come and take the guards. So she took her gun and fought with the jelly monster and destroyed it and saved the guards and the day.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She was four. She always tried to fly. She jumped off of a chair. Boom! Her mom Kate came running in.
“Are you ok?” said her mom.
“Yes” said Lily, but Lily did not give up. She jumped off of everything that was tall but it got late so she went to bed. That night she woke up and started to jump on her bed and started to fly.
The next morning she had school so she went to school. Her teacher’s name was Ms. Rose. Her room was called Room 3. She was learning math. Beep!
“Oh no!” said Lily. “It’s a fire!”
She went out side in a line. She heard a noise. It was saying, “help!”  Lily flew to her classroom.  It was Luna.
“Grab on” said Lily.
She saved Luna’s life so when she went home and told her mom her story, she was famous.

She was on TV and Luna and Lily were best friends. They played together a lot.

Once in a kingdom, there were two boys named Tom and Robert. They lived on a farm. Robert was the elder brother. They would always fight. When their father buys something for Tom, Robert would get angry and fight and vice versa.

One day their father decided to have a competition. There was a bundle of sticks. “The one who breaks the bundle of sticks gets a bar of chocolate” their father said. Robert was the first one. He tried his best but he could not break it. Tom was next. He tried his best but he could not too. Their father asked the boys to break the bunch of sticks together. They replied “It’s worth giving it a shot.” The boys were shocked. They actually broke the bundle. They were really happy and they got a chocolate bar each. They apologized to each other. They understood that unity is strength. They decided that they would never fight again, but would stay and help each other. They lived happily ever after.

Once upon a time there were two girls and they were best friends so it was lucky that they were neighbors. They were both 7 years old and loved adventures. Their names were Molly and Sophie. Molly wore a bow, a ballerina skirt and a white shirt. Sophie wore a flower in her hair, two bracelets, a shiny dress and a big red belt.

One Saturday morning, Molly got dressed to go to Sophie’s house after breakfast. Molly and Sophie went to play in Sophie’s shed. Molly found a loose plank in the shed wall with water pouring out of it. Molly removed the plank and found a tunnel. Molly called Sophie who was looking at all the old gadgets. “Look at this” Molly whispered. “It looks like a tunnel” said Sophie. They went inside the tunnel and at the end there was a door with a knob. Sophie opened the door and the saw the ocean!!

There was a type of portal that stopped the water from coming in the tunnel. Molly went through the portal and a spark of light went around her. She turned into a mermaid!  Then Sophie quickly went through the portal and she turned into a mermaid too!

Just then, Sophie heard a voice calling “Help! Help!”  She said to Molly, “I hear someone calling for help and it’s coming from that cave.  Let’s go and check it out.”  So the two friends swam down to the spooky cave. “It looks like a prison” said Molly. “I see something glittering…it’s a crown!” said Sophie.  “A princess must have been kidnapped,” said Molly.

“I wish we could turn into sharks then we could get the keys guarded by those sharks.” Instantly they turned into big, toothy sharks!  They were able to trick the real sharks into giving them the keys and they freed the princess.

She had silver hair, aqua green eyes and coral pink skin.  Molly asked “How did you end up in the prison?” “Kidnapped” she said.  “Sorry I haven’t introduced myself.  I’m princess Oceana of Pacific and thank you for freeing me.  Now follow me to my father’s castle.”  When they reached, the king was so overjoyed that he gave Sophie and Molly two magic necklaces so they could visit anytime.  They used the necklaces many times for lots of new adventures but that’s a story for another time!
Once upon a time there were 2 twin brothers who were not alike at all. Their names where Tim, and Tom. The twin brothers lived right across a candy shop. Tom always chooses the spicy candy to eat, on the other hand Tim always chooses the sweet candy to eat. One day as they were picking their candy from the candy shop and eating it. While they were eating the candy, their father said to have a race around the park. So they went to the starting line.
As soon as the race began Tom started to run but Tim walked slowly behind. A few minutes later Tom went for a drink of water because he was thirsty of all the running he did and the spicy candy started to kick in. While Tom was drinking Tim got ahead. Then After Tom’s drink was over he looked behind and thought Tim was really behind but really he wasn't. So he sat on a stump and was playing with a twig.
A few minutes later Tim crossed the finish line and he won the race. As soon as Tom found out the news he wasn't mad he congratulated his brother and they lived happily ever after.
In a faraway land named Bookville there was a library, but it was not a normal library it was a floating library! Many people came to the library on boats and cars. Hundreds of people filled the library everyday. At night a little mouse named Sam came out and took papers from the librarians desk, and took them into his hole. He had written books for his whole life, but he had never shown them to anyone. Sams whole room was filled with books. The only furniture he had was a desk, a chair, a fridge, and a bed.

One day Sam thought he should show his books to everyone. He made up his mind and the next day he put the books in the shelves where they belonged. A few minutes later a child found one of Sams small books. She took the book to the librarians desk and asked her, Who wrote the book? The librarian said, I do not know who wrote this book, but I can hang a poster asking who wrote the books.

The next day the librarian hung a poster saying: Who has been writing small books? If you are the author please come to the librarians desk. That night when Sam came out to put his books in the shelves he saw the poster and read it. He finally decided to come out the next day. He came to the librarians desk the next day and told the librarian he was the author of the small books. The librarian was very proud of Sam. She told him she would tell him a big surprise the next day. The next day Sam came back to the librarians desk and asked the librarian, Can you tell the big surprise? She told Sam that she was going to open a small class called Little Authors. Sam was going to help children write their own books! The next day the class opened and many kids came. There were twenty kids and Sam helped all of them!
On reaching the Panthera International Airport, Muzful Islam was struck by a huge wave of surprise as he noticed the environment. Light blue coloured ponds, huge oak trees and dew drops that shimmered like golden spangled jelabis in the weak January sun. 'As I stepped out on the soft moss, a driver assisted me to his horse carriage. Loading up the heavy luggage, we soon set off', said Muzful. As the cart jingled, Muzful saw the beauties of Panthera. Migratory birds chirped melodiously. Quaint houses with zinc roofs could be seen. Oak trees reached out their branches, as if beckoning to him 'come closer to us'. And within all of this calmness, eagle-eyed soldiers patrolled the spick-and-span streets.

A little later, Muzful arrived at the Coast Hotel. The staff greeted him warmly. 'My feet and hands were numb and stiff because of the biting wind. As soon as I entered my room, I felt snug and cozy. The roaring fire in the grate blazed and made me feel I had sunk into a hot bath after a long, tiresome day. I then sipped some cocoa and fell asleep', recalls Muzful.

Next early morning, as Muzful was a fitness fanatic, he went for morning walks. The sky was becoming a forget-me-not-blue, red mud was noticed, rain was dripping from the zinc roofs, trees were reaching out their branches to scratch Muzful's face, and the music band of birds were chirping their first note. Soon Muzful returned to the hotel, bolted down his breakfast (which consisted of a crust of bread and lip smacking mashed vegetables), and set off for Berk, Panthera's capital.

Half 'n' hour later Muzful was on the Anabell Ship. It set off, leaving a foamy cake on the shallow sea. Panthera had long since become a tiny speck, so Muzful looked towards the salty sea. Fishes were swimming swiftly, their bodies glistening like rubies. In the distance, snow covered mountain peaks seemed like huge, colossal, black towers.

As Muzful arrived at Berk he was spellbound. He was completely bowled over by the natural wildlife.

Clumps of rhododendrons were scattered everywhere. Nearby a clear river was flowing, making the usual plish-plash noise. A gaggle of geese were swimming in the river, making a gentle ripple. Even though Berk was a small island, it was set amidst an oasis of greenery. Cattle were grazing on the lush, green grass. Muzful noticed Panthera flags waving vigorously in the wind on top of wooden fences. Guards were scouting, keeping a firm eye. There were gay buildings that attracted tourists. About 10 km away, there stood an elegant castle which was the residence of the government.

Soon it was time to return. So, after reaching Panthera, Muzful packed up his suitcase and reached the airport. Then he bid bye to the staff and returned to his home at Zerta.

Life in Panthera is a far cry from main cities. So, for a relaxing tour just land at Panthera and chill your hot mind.

Once upon a time, there was a boy named James. He always got pushed around.

One day, a wizard appeared in front of the boy.

The wizard gave James three wishes.

One of James wishes was that tge wizard could make James go away.

The next day James tried to make a wish, but he found himself to be in the land of the forgotten.

He wasnt able to make anymore wishes.

Everyone in town was looking for James.

The next day after that, an old man came outside. The old man figured out that it was the wizard that made James disappear.

The old man screamed, "James is in the Land of the forgotten! The wizard did it! He had to!"

Everyone who was looking for James stopped. They didnt know where the Land of the forgotten was.

James was now lost, And the lost boy never returned.

In the land of the forgotten, people age alot faster. When James had first disappeared, he was only seven years old.

After three 'real life' years James suddenly returned to his town. But because he was in the land of the forgotten for so long, he was now 40 years old!

James went to see his mother.

Even though James was all grown up looking, his mother knew who he was right away. As she opened the door, she looked in James eyes and said "oh my God, I knpw you are my son, but you are all grown up" "come here, my son, ive missed you so much."

James hugged his mom. His mom was so excited that James was back. Everyone in town was happy.

Since James was all grown up looking, he wasnt picked on anymore.

Everyone then lived, happily ever after.

One day, Brent was very thirsty. He wanted a milkshake. He asked his mum to take him to the cpgrocery story to get the ingredients for his milkshake. "What flavour milkshake do you want, Brent?" Asked his mum.
"I want a blueberry milkshake, please, mum!" Replied Brent.
Brent's mum pulled out a list. On that list was:
– milk
– ice cream
– blueberries
-cream
-sprinkles
Brent and his mum first went to the fruit section and looked for some yummy blueberries. After a little while, Brent found some yummy looking big blueberries. "These look lovely Brent they will taste amazing in our milkshake!"
Next they went to the milk section. Brent chose a big bottle of milk, and Brent's mum reached up high to get the whipped cream for the milkshake.
Then Brent led the way to the icecream section. "Can we please get some blueberry icecream to go with our milkshake?" Asked Brent. "Of course!" Replied Brent's mum with a smile. The icecream was added to the trolley.

Brent and his mum went to the check out and paid for their ingredients. In the car on the way home, Brent was very excited. "Can we make the milkshakes as soon as we get home?" He asked his mum. "Yes of course, then we can drink our milkshakes while we are watching our movie!"

But, when Brent and his mum got home and checked the shopping list, they discovered they had forgotten the sprinkles! Brent got very upset and Brent's mum had to give him a big cuddle.
"It's okay Brent, I have some sprinkles in the cupboard. Which colour would you like for your milkshake?"
Brent thought for a minute "orange sprinkles please mum!"

All the ingredients were gathered into the bench, and Brent helped his mum pour the milk into the blender, then a big scoop of icecream, and finally a handful of blueberries to make it yummy.
Once the milkshake was all mixed up, Brent helped his mum put the whipped cream on top and then covered it in sprinkles.
The milkshake looked amazing, and Brent and his mum spent the rest of the afternoon watching minions and drinking yummy blueberry milkshakes, snuggled up on the couch.
The end.

Once upon a time, there was an owl who was very friendly and lived in a large home.  Everyone loved to sleep over on Friday nights. Although she was a little naughty, she always listened to her Mom. She asked lots of questions and shared her hopes and fears. Her mom tried to teach her about life.  Although her mom warned her specifically about safety, the little Owl always wanted to try things on her own rather than listen to her mom’s advice.  Owl’s curiosity tested her mom’s patience at times.

Like this, playfully when she tried to see the lightning,she learnt a lesson that not to double check whatever mom says.Whatever Mom says,its all for our good.Now understand the causes and effects of trying all things in practical.

Only that time she is very scared and ask her mom to forgive her not to repeat this mistake. From that day onwards she stop testing whatever her mom says.She stopped checking the idea of learning everything in practical ways.

One day, when her friends were sleeping over, the clouds came rolling in and the wind began to howl.  As the night grew dark, Owl and her friends wanted to have some fun watching the rain beat against the window panes and feel the energy from the window panes.  The storm grew worse as lightening lit up the sky and thunder roared. They were engulfed by fear but wanted to watch the storm. Owl’s mom asked them to step away from the window so no one would get hurt.  They ignored her request and continued to watch as the drops of rain beat down harder and harder.  All of a sudden, they heard a loud clap of thunder followed by a bright flash of lighting. After this, little Owl couldn’t see anything but bright white. she was very frightened and her friends called for her mom.  Her mom ran from the kitchen and took Owl to the hospital nearby.  The Doctor checked her out and told her that there was nothing to worry about and she’d be fine within the hour.  All she needed was a little rest.

“Getting bullied again, are we?” asked Mr Thompson unsympathetically. “Yes I am,” replied Ben in a low and nervous voice. “Well, we will deal with this next week; keep on writing in your feelings diary.” Ben skulked out of the unpredictable Headmaster’s office, whilst fiddling with the wrecked sleeves of his jumper (this was something even the Headmaster liked to pick on.)

Spontaneously, the awful bullies strolled around the corner… Ben hid with fear. As soon as the bullies ambled weirdly passed, Ben dashed into the classroom and sat down, like a cat chasing a mouse. However Ben forgot his awesome bag. He was shaking a lot. Ben really didn’t want to step out that mammoth door. Slowly, Ben got up and peered around the door but didn’t realise the bullies were the other side. Charlie was feeling pugnacious, like a tiger ready to pounce. The hooligans grabbed Ben and dragged him over to the lockers; Ben was petrified.

“Go away,” whimpered Ben.

“You’re such a wuss,” sniggered Tyrese whilst holding his torn, ragged and rampaged bag. The bullies threw roughly Ben’s bag into his face. A nose bleed – only his third this month.

Ben rushed to the bathroom to avoid more embarrassment. As soon as he got into the cubicle, Ben threw up into the toilet; it was horrid. Ben sauntered out of the cubical, frightened someone was going to heavily laugh at him. Ben crept around the corner still looking behind, checking if anyone was going to sneak up on him. As soon as Ben got into the classroom, everyone turned off and went silent. He sat down feeling mortified, whilst noticing the bullies staring at him, laughing.
About halfway through the lesson, Ben started getting out of breath and his heart was pounding rapidly. On the way home from a horrendous day at school, Ben was walking clumsily down the path towards his house. Little did he know, something was coming for him that he wasn’t expecting. Worse than the bullies.

For five consecutive days, the chest pain was sneaking into his body – swiftly, as in second by second, the pain was becoming more and more intense. How has he kept this a secret from his parents? It was on the sixth day, whilst trying to walk normally, he fainted with terror. He was in school when this incident occurred, no more than a metre away from Tyrese and Charlie…

Steadily, Ben opened his eyes and saw a luminous white wall, doctors, other children crying. As he eased himself up, the closest doctor pushed him back down in bed, telling him to take it easy.

Meanwhile at school Charlie and Tyrese were feeling awfully guilty. Were they to blame for this brutal incident? </em>

As the doctor slowly put the needle in Ben’s backhand, he immediately went to sleep as quickly as someone running away from a bear. Curiously, his mum wandered over to the clipboard, containing all of Ben’s medical information, it said ‘Diagnosis – Rheumatic Heart Disease! Further tests needed.’ Ben’s mum clutched at her own heart in horror…

Sneakily, in the middle of the night whilst his mother slept, Doctors were taking Ben out into ‘The Room’ that had an unimaginable amount of tools, pins, needles. Trying to not let the Doctors observe that he had his eyes open, Ben was only just conscious. Ben was discovering this secret room while the Doctors were getting their gloves and goggles on. But it was too late. One of the doctors knocked over a poisonous potion, flaring all over Ben. Ben believed his life had come to an end…

An hour after Ben had died, spontaneously his eyes started to flicker at the same moment the machines started rhythmically beeping once more. It was a miracle; his mum couldn’t believe it – he was the first boy to come back to life. Without hesitation, Ben sat up feeling completely fine like nothing had happened.

The next day everyone was really confused. Ben was on the news – ‘First Human To Come Back To Life’. After that day, everyone rushed home and quickly and switched on the news. Ben was everywhere. The next day, the whole school got pieces of paper and sprinted, like they never could before, to Ben to ask questions. Ben was famous. To him, it was like a dream come true.
Once upon a time there was a little sock.

He was going to the lake to go fishing.

Just then, a little boy passed by. The little boy held his nose because he thought that the sock smelled.
Just then he had an idea. Since the garbage was right next to him, he decided to throw the sock away.

Little did the boy know, the sock was real and had real feelings.

The little boy apologized to the sock and asked him if they could be friends.

The sock was SO happy to have a new friend, he invited the boy to his house for a play date.

The two became best friends forever
Buddy and Diamond are my pet gerbils. One day Buddy got Diamond to stand on her shoulders and open the cage. They climbed out.

They went to my room and got in the toy jeep and they drove out of my room. They drove down the stairs.
They drove out the dog door and drove to the gate. The dog came to the gate and opened the gate. Then they drove to a party and did the disco.

A cat broke into the party.

The gerbils did the ‘Scaredy Cat’ disco, which goes like . . .disco, disco, disco, scaredy cat, scaredy cat, got to go!
Once upon a time, there lived an old lady and an old man and they planted peas, green beans, and one enormous turnip. One day, the old man had an idea. The old man went to fetch three black cats, two dogs, a farmer, five pigs, sixteen hens, a thousand chicks, and one hundred and eight ducks. He said, “I know what we can have for dinner. Turnip stew.”
But there was one thing that the farmer didn’t know. The turnip was stubborn. Now, the old lady asked her wonderful husband, “where is the turnip for our stew?” The farmer said “sorry my beautiful wife, the turnip was so stubborn, it wouldn’t come out of the ground!” Five minutes after, they heard a little squeaky voice, it was two little puppies. And they wanted to help pull the stubborn turnip out. But the farmer just said “it won’t do any difference at all. But to see if it works, let’s give it a try!” So they did.

The puppies helped . . . and that very moment, the turnip went flying out of its pit. So they had turnip stew, after all.

And they lived happily ever after.
My baby brother’s first day was so much fun.
I went to the hospital to see him and his eyes opened and saw the new world he was in.
It was a great feeling to hold him in my hands. Inside the hospital I got snacks and water from a vending machine. And then we went outside to play. We went home with our mom and dad and everyone in our family was so excited to see the new born baby. It was the greatest day of my life.
It was a dense, black night. A heavy coat of darkness seemed to rest on the world. If you had spied me, you would think me as a treading night- hunter. Quickly, I managed to slip in Count Visiaka’s room like a stealthy beast, through the open window. The Count had delved deep into history books when he suddenly spotted me. Greeting me with a wide smile, he embraced me. The next few hours he was silent and grave, and his facial expression blackened as I narrated Hector’s evil plot. Later, I handed him two Holland rifles and a revolver. All of a sudden, we heard gunfire. One of Hector’s comrades had pried on us, and had sent word to him. I left the Count to shoot Hector’s gunner and diverted Hector, along with his brothers, Alfred and Edward leading them to River Yanka. Hector’s flaming eyes were mad with rage, and was charging like an angry bull with revolver aimed at me. I led them over the cracked, Yosa village road, through the Illaga Caves and Hollow Mountains where took birth burnt stubble and small chunks of rocks. Suddenly, Edward shot me on my shoulder. Groaning in agony, I finally led them to River Yanka and hurled rocks at them. Seething with rage, Hector, Alfred and Edward charged but slipped on slushy mud and toppled into River Yanka. Grappling each other, they splashed and then drowned. In dancing moonlight, I could see three corpses floating towards hell. Count Visiaka’s life was saved!
